DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

store the repeated states in matrix
longest common subsequence/string

overlapping sub-problems (sub problems already solved and need to be solved again)
optimal sub-structure (problems need to be soved to the main problem should be smaller than the main problem)
recursive

solve side by side and save
bottom-up approach

base condition
formula(general expression)
